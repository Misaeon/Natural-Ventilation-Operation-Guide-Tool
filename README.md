# Natural Ventilation Operation Guide Tool
The software was developed as one of the main deliverables of the **IAQ4EDU** research project.

Under the premise of meeting both **Indoor Air Quality** goals and students' **Thermal Comfort** needs, the software provides school teachers with guidance and recommendations for **Natural Ventilation Operation**, based on simple parameters for given classroom characteristics and outdoor weather conditions.

The software estimates the natural ventilation rates that can be achieved based on the EN 16798-7 model, given the classroom characteristics and outdoor weather conditions. It also checks the compliance of the ventilation effect and thermal conditions with ISO/ASHRAE/EN standards and provides recommendations for improvements.
